There is not enough time, between showings, to let every single person in the cinema leave. Some lag behind and are engulfed in a flood of
newcomers. Particularly if they are alone and have no one to remind them who exactly they are, the sum of memories that made them into a
person who had just watched a film and was baout to leave the cinema, gets washed away by the spunky eagerness of those walking in. The 
straggler, already standing, with her phone and jacket in her hands, about to leave her row, ebbs back into it pushed by the current. And 
as the current slackens, is deposited far into the row like dry seaweed left behind by a receding wave.
Outside, beyond the network of low-ceilinged tunnels into which all the projection rooms pour out, there is night where there wasn't. A 
fantastic carnage is going on, where masses of colour sweep onto others, wholly erradicating them only to immediately be swallowed by 
another angular sheet of light and metal. And these feed on each other inexhaustably, eat and are eaten, but remain wholly unchanged. 
Fuelled by whichever force compels them and by one's walking too.
